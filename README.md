This repository holds the source code for some of my writing, together with the custom build system for rendering the sources into html files. Feel free to use the issue tracker for feedback on the writing, but please indicate which piece of writing you are referring to.

I consider the build system a fruitful experiment, but also pretty horrible in its current state; and I do not plan to fight that horribleness. In particular, I will not make it more accessible, provide documentation, or implement features beyond anything I might personally need. If you find yourself thinking about using the build system yourself, please contact me so that I can talk you out of it. Writing a new build system from scratch will be a nicer experience than using mine.
