          A §define(set)(set) is a collection of objects that ignores the order of those objects and how often they occur.
        )§p(
          We denote a §r(set) by listing its objects within curly braces, separated by commas, for example: §$(§$set(1)(2)(3)).
        )§p(
          The §define(empty_set)(empty set) §$(§$set()) — the collection that contains no objects at all — is also written as §$(§$set).
        )
      )

      §p(
        Because a §r(set) ignores the order of its objects, §$(§$set(1)(2)), and §$(§$set(2)(1)) both denote the same §r(set). Since a §r(set) also ignores how often its object occur, §$(§$set(1)(2)) and §$(§$set(1)(2)(1)) also denote the same §r(set). All three expressions are simply different ways of denoting the unique mathematical object characterized by the fact that §$(1) and §$(2) belong to it, but nothing else does.
      )§p(
        We now introduce more succinct terminology for talking about which objects do and which objects do not belong to a particular §r(set).

          To express that an object §$(x) occurs in a §r(set) §$(X), we write §$(x §$in X), and we say that §verbatim(§$(x) is an §define(element)(element) of §$(X)), §verbatim(§$(x) is a §define(member)(member) of §$(X)), or more simply that §verbatim(§$(x) §define(in)(in) §$(X)).

      §p(
        We can visualize §rs(member)(set membership) by drawing §rs(set) as blobs that enclose their §rs(element). §cref(example_euler_diagram) demonstrates such an §define["euler_diagram"](euler_diagram)(Euler diagram). Note how the idea of a §r(set) containing §rs(element) multiple times or in a particular order cannot even be expressed in these depictions, making §rs(euler_diagram) a more faithful representations of §rs(set) than our written notation.
